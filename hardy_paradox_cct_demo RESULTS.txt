hardy_paradox_cct_demo RESULTS

Complete Hardy's paradox demonstration using the validated KappaAdaptiveCCTPredictor.
Shows how CCT framework resolves the "impossible" joint probabilities through geometric
context analysis without violating quantum mechanics.

Hardy's Setup:
- Entangled electron-positron pair in overlapping Mach-Zehnder interferometers
- Four detection outcomes: C⁺_e, D⁻_e (electron), C⁺_p, D⁻_p (positron)
- Paradox: Quantum mechanics predicts "impossible" joint detection events

CCT Resolution:
- Each measurement outcome defines a different geometric context
- Context shifts have measurable geometric cost (χ, κ, γ)
- Classical joint probability assumptions invalid due to observer-dependence

📊 HARDY QUANTUM PROBABILITIES
--------------------------------------------------
Key Hardy probabilities:
  P(both same path) = 0.052632
  P(e at C⁺) = 0.657895
  P(p at C⁺) = 0.657895
  P(p D⁻|e C⁺) = 0.020000
  P(e D⁻|p C⁺) = 0.020000
  P(e C⁺ ∧ p D⁻) = 0.013158

🎯 THE HARDY PARADOX:
──────────────────────────────
Standard Hardy reasoning:
  1. P(both same path) = 0.052632
  2. Since P(uu) + P(ll) is small, particles are usually on different paths
  3. If e detected at C⁺, then e was in superposition of paths
  4. Since 'no same path', p should be detected at D⁻ with high probability
  5. But QM gives P(p D⁻|e C⁺) = 0.020 ≠ 1
  6. Joint probability P(e C⁺ ∧ p D⁻) = 0.013158
CCT Resolution: Context shifts invalidate joint probability reasoning
